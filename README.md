# stocks-analysis
For your written analysis, be sure to use complete and coherent sentences. Your written analysis should contain three sections, which cover the following:

Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Our purpose was to refactor the stock analysis code so the run time would be faster. For his parents running thousands of numbers instead of hundreds. The code is supposed loop through the data one time at faster pace.


Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script. My 2018 data ran faster than my 2017 data in refactored script. The original runs slower than the refactored script. I added a (for) loop to my arrays. And a (for) to dataRowStart and dataRowEnd, and If Else as well.


Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? The advantages, we already had code to work to help us get started with the challenge. The disadvantages, we needed to figure out to make the run time faster than the original script. It also can be frustrating when the code does not work as expected.
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script? Pros we have learned how to refactor code for VBA script. We learned we take an old code refactor it new and make it faster. Cons it was very time consuming, and the smallest errors will cause a debugging issue. There is also a lot of formatting for this code.
